# Intro

## Background

碳排放数量增长

Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2020 with larger absolute decadal increases toward the end of this period. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emission increase from 1970 to 2020, with a similar percentage contribution for the period 2000–2010.

经济活动影响碳排放

Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2010 and 2020 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply  

迫切需要行动

Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, emissions growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities. Baseline scenarios, those without additional mitigation, result in global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared to pre-industrial levels.

城市转型与碳排放

Cities, the core of the global [climate change mitigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/climate-change-mitigation) and strategic low-carbon development, are shelters to more than half of the world population and responsible for three quarters of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG). 

## Overview

This project intended to promotes multi- and inter- disciplinary analyses and discussions on the climate change mitigation. Our project are then divided into four themes, including  

. 

First, this SV provides methods for constructing emission inventory from both production and consumption perspectives. These methods are useful to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of [carbon accounting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/carbon-accounting) for international cities. 

Second, the climate change affects urban sectors from various aspects; simultaneously, GHG emissions caused by activities in urban sectors affect the climate system. This SV focuses on mitigation policies and assessment of energy, transport, construction, and service sectors. 

Third, climate change mitigation of cities is closely connected to [urban sustainable development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/sustainable-urban-development). This SV explores the relationships between climate change mitigation with urbanization, ecosystems, air pollution, and extreme events. 

Fourth, climate change mitigation policies can be divided into two categories: quantity-based mechanism (e.g., [carbon emission](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/carbon-emission) trading) and price-based mechanism (e.g., carbon tax). This SV provides experiences of local climate change mitigation all over the world and proposes the city-to-city cooperation on climate change mitigation.

## Findings

Overall, per-capita emissions in the highly industrialized countries are roughly flat over time and remain, on average, about 5 times higher than those of the lowest income countries whose per-capita emissions are also roughly flat. Per-capita emissions from upper-middle income countries have been rising steadily over the last decade. There are substantial differences between mean and median per-capita emissions, reflecting the huge variation within
